  {
    question: "Can I download clips from Twitch VODs?",
    answer: "You can create clips from VODs on Twitch first, then download those clips using our tool. Direct VOD downloads aren't supported, but all saved clips work perfectly."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I save Twitch highlight reels?",
    answer: "Highlight reels are longer than standard clips. If they're saved as VODs, you'll need to clip specific moments first, then download those individual clips."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I download Twitch clips from deleted channels?",
    answer: "Unfortunately, clips from deleted or banned channels are removed from Twitch servers. Download clips you want to preserve while the channel is still active."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I download clips with streamer overlays intact?",
    answer: "All overlays, alerts, and stream graphics are preserved in downloads. You get the complete clip exactly as it appeared during the live stream."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I save Twitch clips from subscriber-only streams?",
    answer: "Subscriber-only clips can only be accessed if you're subscribed. Our tool downloads publicly accessible clips without requiring Twitch login."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I download tournament or esports clips from Twitch?",
    answer: "Tournament clips download like any other Twitch clip. Copy the clip URL from official tournament channels and save in source quality for best results."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I download clips with Twitch chat replay?",
    answer: "Clips contain only the video content, not the chat overlay. Chat replays are a separate Twitch feature not included in downloaded clips."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I save clips from Twitch mobile app?",
    answer: "Tap the share button on any clip in the Twitch mobile app, select 'Copy Link', then paste into our web-based downloader on your mobile browser."
