  {
    question: "Can I download profile pictures from private accounts?",
    answer: "You can download profile pictures from private Instagram accounts only if the profile picture itself is set to public. Most profile pictures are visible even on private accounts.

  },
  {
    question: "How to see full size dp on Instagram?",

  },
  {
    question: "Is it legal to download someone's profile picture?",
    answer: "Downloading profile pictures for personal use (like saving a friend's photo or viewing in full size) is generally acceptable.

Always respect privacy and use downloaded images responsibly."

  },
  {
    question: "What format are downloaded profile pictures?",
    answer: "Profile pictures are available in JPG and PNG formats. JPG is recommended for smaller file sizes while maintaining high quality.

  },
  {
    question: "Why can't I see some profile pictures?",
    answer: "If a profile picture doesn't load, possible reasons include: the account doesn't exist, the username is incorrect, the account is completely private with restricted profile picture access, the account was deleted or banned, or there's a temporary server issue. Verify the username is correct and the profile is accessible on the actual platform."
  },
