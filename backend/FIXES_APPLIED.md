# Fixes Applied - YouTube & Instagram Download Errors

## Date: 2025-10-11

## Issues Fixed

### 1. YouTube Error: "ERROR: could not find chrome cookies database in '/root/.config/google-chrome'"

**Root Cause:**
- The YouTube downloader was attempting to access browser cookies from Chrome/Firefox/Edge
- In production/VPS environments, browser applications are not installed
- This caused the "could not find chrome cookies database" error

**Solution:**
- Disabled browser cookie detection in production environment
- Modified `_detect_available_browser()` method to return `None` immediately
- Removed `cookiesfrombrowser` option from yt-dlp configuration
- Most public YouTube videos work without authentication

**Files Modified:**
- `youtube.py` (lines 12-17, 73-75)

---

### 2. Instagram Error: "Instagram requires authentication for this content"

**Root Cause:**
- Instagram downloader was trying to use browser cookies for authentication
- Without cookies, Instagram's API requires login for certain content
- The extractor was configured to prefer GraphQL API which requires authentication

**Solution:**
- Disabled browser cookie detection for Instagram
- Modified extractor configuration:
  - Set `webpage_api: True` (always use webpage API)
  - Set `prefer_graphql: False` (disable GraphQL which needs auth)
  - Kept `mobile_api: True` for better compatibility
- Improved error messages with specific guidance for users
- Added retry logic before giving up on authentication errors

**Files Modified:**
- `instagram.py` (lines 12-17, 70-77, 85-87, 299-323)

def _detect_available_browser(self):
    print("Browser cookie detection disabled for production environment")
    return None
```

        'mobile_api': True,
        'prefer_graphql': False,  # Disable GraphQL (requires auth)

}

# Improved error handling with better messages
```

## Deployment Instructions

### For Local Development:
1. Navigate to backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\rafey1\Desktop\youtude video final\snapsavepro\backend"
   ```

2. Run the restart script:
   ```bash
   restart_server.bat
   ```

### For VPS/Production Server:
1. Pull the latest changes to your server
2. Restart the backend service:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/snapsavepro/backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   python app.py
   ```

   OR if using systemd:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart snapsavepro-backend
   ```

## Important Notes

### YouTube:
- ✅ Public videos will work without authentication
- ✅ Age-restricted videos may still require authentication
- ✅ Private videos cannot be downloaded

### Instagram:
- ✅ Public posts and reels should work
- ✅ Public IGTV videos should work
- ⚠️ Private accounts require authentication
- ⚠️ Stories may require authentication
- ⚠️ Some content may still require login depending on Instagram's restrictions

### Browser Cookies:
- Browser cookie detection is now **disabled** by default
- This prevents errors in production environments
- If you need to download private/restricted content, you'll need to implement:
  - Cookie file upload feature
  - Or OAuth authentication
  - Or session token management

---

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### YouTube:
- Public videos: ✅ Download works
- Error message: Clear error for age-restricted/private videos

### Instagram:
- Public posts/reels: ✅ Download should work
- Private content: Clear error message with suggestions
- Error message includes: "Only public Instagram posts and reels can be downloaded without authentication"

## Monitoring & Logs

To monitor if the fixes are working in production:

1. Check backend logs for:
   - "Browser cookie detection disabled for production environment"
   - "Running without browser cookies (production mode)"

2. Look for absence of:
   - "could not find chrome cookies database"
   - Cookie-related errors in yt-dlp

3. Test with sample URLs:
   - YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
   - Instagram: Any public post or reel URL
